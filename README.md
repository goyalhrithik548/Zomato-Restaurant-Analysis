## Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of a global Zomato restaurant dataset. The primary goal is to conduct descriptive and statistical analysis to uncover insights about restaurant distribution, ratings, cuisines, and services worldwide. The workflow involves data cleaning and preparation using **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) and creating a dynamic, interactive dashboard for visualization using **Power BI**.

The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle** and is owned by **Zomato**.

## Key Questions Addressed

The analysis focuses on answering several key business questions:

  * What is the total number of restaurants and cuisines available globally?
  * Which countries have the highest concentration of Zomato-listed restaurants?
  * Which Indian cities offer the best "value for money" restaurants?
  * What are the top 10 most popular cuisines in India based on votes?
  * Which countries have a high prevalence of restaurants offering online delivery?
  * Which localities have the most restaurants?
  * What are the characteristics of restaurants with good cuisine and high average ratings?

## Methodology

The project was executed in two main phases:

### 1\. Data Cleaning and Preparation (Python)

The raw data was loaded and processed using **Pandas** and **NumPy** libraries. The cleaning process included:

  * Dropping unnecessary columns to reduce noise.
  * Removing duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
  * Cleaning and formatting data within individual rows for consistency.

### 2\. Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)

After cleaning, the dataset was imported into Power BI to develop a fully interactive dashboard. The dashboard visualizes the key findings and allows users to explore the data dynamically.

## Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard provides a consolidated view of the analysis, featuring key metrics, geographical distributions, and cuisine analytics.
